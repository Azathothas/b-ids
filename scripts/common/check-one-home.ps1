# check-one-home.ps1 - does any sentence appear in two documents?
#
# ⭐ THE TWIN OF check-one-home.sh. Same schema, same exit codes, same
# threshold, same exemptions.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT: one fact with two homes. docs/conventions/prose.md has always
# said every fact lives in exactly one document, and nothing checked it, so it
# drifted the way an unchecked rule always drifts. The copy a reader trusts is
# whichever they saw first, and the wrong one is invisible until somebody
# notices the two disagree.
#
# ⭐ WHAT IT COST, MEASURED. A project built from `Azathothas/TEMPLATE`
# accumulated 8 sentences appearing verbatim in two documents and 3 whole
# sections that were near-copies of a convention, in a file that opened by
# saying it restated nothing. That template's own tree, checked for the first
# time on 2026-08-28, held 42 duplicated sentences of 8 words or more.
#
# ⭐ THIS TREE WAS BOOTSTRAPPED FROM IT AND INHERITED THE SHAPE. First run
# here, 2026-08-29, before anything was cleaned: 17 sentences of 12 words or
# more with two homes, 7 of them involving a skeleton copied across and never
# filled in.
#
# -- ⚠ THE FIRST RUN OF THE INSTRUMENT REPORTED ZERO, AND WAS WRONG ----------
#
# ⛔ It reported no duplicates at any threshold over a 60-file document set,
# because its file collector matched NOTHING: a quoted pathspec reached git
# through a shell that treats a quote as an ordinary character. Zero duplicates
# over zero files reads exactly like a clean tree.
#
# ⭐ That is why this refuses to report success over an empty scope.
#
# -- THE EXEMPTIONS ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# ⛔ THERE IS NO ROUTER EXEMPTION ANY MORE, AND ITS REMOVAL IS THE POINT.
# AGENTS.md and docs/AGENTS.md each stated the absolutes in full, and this check
# exempted the pair from each other by name. DOC-07 deleted the root file on
# 2026-08-30, so there is one router and nothing is duplicated. ⭐ An exemption
# for a file that no longer exists grants itself to whatever lands at that path
# next, so it is deleted rather than emptied.
#
# ⛔ docs/HISTORY/ IS EXEMPT ENTIRELY: a retired page states things the live
# pages now state differently, or no longer state at all, which is the point of
# it. docs/conventions/prose.md is the rule that sends wording there.
#
# ⚠ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: a fact restated in different words. That is a reading.
# Verbatim duplication is what copy-and-paste actually produces, and that is
# what this holds.
