# check-placeholders.ps1 - did a template placeholder survive into a real file?
#
# ⭐ THE TWIN OF check-placeholders.sh. Same schema, same exit codes, same
# exemptions. check-twins.sh is what stops the two drifting.
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a document that reads as finished and is
# not. A leftover double-brace marker in a router, a record or a licence is a
# sentence that looks authoritative and says nothing, and the next session acts
# on it. The failure is quiet: nothing errors, and the file is the right shape.
#
# It also catches the other half, which is easier to miss: a template GUIDANCE
# comment left in a real file. Those read as instructions and are addressed to
# whoever was filling the file in, not to whoever is reading it now.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-placeholders.ps1
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-placeholders.ps1 -Json
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 something survived, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

        #    template calls functions as well as reading fields, so `{{json`,
