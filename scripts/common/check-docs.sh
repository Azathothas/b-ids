#!/bin/sh
# check-docs.sh - do the documents still resolve, and are they written the way
# this repository writes documents?
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a document that was true when it was
# written. Four shapes of it, and every one is invisible to every other check:
#
#   - a link or a path that stopped resolving when something was renamed;
#   - a fenced shell block that does not parse, which is a block nobody can
#     copy and paste;
#   - an angle-bracket placeholder inside a shell block: a human reads it as
#     "fill this in" and bash reads it as a redirect, so the reader gets a
#     cryptic syntax error instead of an obvious instruction.
#
# ⚠ CONTROL BYTES ARE NOT CHECKED HERE. That rule scanned markdown only while
# every .ts, .py, .rs and .sh in the tree went unchecked, so it moved to
# check-control-bytes.sh, which reads every text file. Run both.
#
# ⚠ THE CHARACTER HALF OF THE PROSE RULE IS NOT HERE. No em dash and no
# character outside the five belong to check-markers.sh, which reads every
# tracked text file rather than markdown alone. Run both. What stays here is
# what is specific to a document: links, fenced blocks, placeholders, banned
# vocabulary and orphan pages.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK IS WHETHER A CLAIM IS TRUE. That is a reading, and
# it belongs to the review pass. A guard that tried to verify prose would
# either pass vacuously or refuse legitimate writing, and both are worse than
# an honest scope.
#
# ⚠ EVERY PER-LINE TEST IS DONE IN awk, NOT IN A SHELL LOOP. The first version
# ran a pipeline per line of every file, which is tens of thousands of process
# spawns, and it did not finish in two minutes on Windows. One awk pass per
# file replaced it. The shell only touches the filesystem, which is the one
# thing awk should not be doing here.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-docs.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-docs.sh --json
#   sh scripts/common/check-docs.sh --path docs
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 something is wrong, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

# trimmed, their pages are orphaned relative to this tree, and their templates
# hold placeholders on purpose. None of that is a defect here, and a check that
# fails on a correct tree gets switched off within a week.
#
# ⭐ EVERY CHECK EXEMPTS IT, AND EACH EXEMPTION WAS PAID FOR SEPARATELY. The
# prose checks, because it is somebody else's writing. check-control-bytes,
# because .gitattributes declares `references/** -text` so the corpus is stored
# byte-exact as evidence, and a finding there could only be fixed by editing the
# bytes a citation points at. check-no-secrets, after every hit it produced over
# the corpus was read once and recorded; its own header carries the counts.
# ⚠ A check whose findings cannot be acted on is a check that gets switched off,
# and an exemption taken without reading first is one nobody can defend.

# ⚠ FOUR OF THE EIGHTEEN ARE DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: simply, just, obviously
# and "of course". They are banned as DISMISSALS, telling a reader who is stuck

# positive rate is a guard somebody switches off, so those four stay a reading
