# check-placeholders.sh - did a template placeholder survive into a real file?
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a document that reads as finished and is
# not. A leftover {{PLACEHOLDER}} in a router, a record or a licence is a
# sentence that looks authoritative and says nothing, and the next session acts
# on it. The failure is quiet: nothing errors, and the file is the right shape.
#
# It also catches the other half, which is easier to miss: a template GUIDANCE
# comment left in a real file. Those read as instructions and are addressed to
# whoever was filling the file in, not to whoever is reading it now.
#
# Run it at the end of a bootstrap, and as a gate afterwards.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-placeholders.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-placeholders.sh --json
#   sh scripts/common/check-placeholders.sh --path docs
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 something survived, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

# a file that has never been staged, which is exactly when a new file is most
# likely to carry a defect and exactly what the next `git add -A` will take.
# Ignored files stay out: they are ignored on purpose.

# -- ⛔ THE REFERENCE CORPUS IS EXEMPT, AND ONLY FROM THIS CHECK'S SUBJECT ----
#
# `references/` holds other projects' trees, at named commits, as the evidence
# behind docs/reference-sweeps/findings.md. docs/methodology/references.md is
# why it is tracked rather than deleted.
#
# ⛔ It is somebody else's writing, so this project's rules about how a document
# is written cannot apply to it. Their links point into subtrees this sweep
# trimmed, their pages are orphaned relative to this tree, and their templates
# hold placeholders on purpose. None of that is a defect here, and a check that
# fails on a correct tree gets switched off within a week.
#
# ⭐ EVERY CHECK EXEMPTS IT, AND EACH EXEMPTION WAS PAID FOR SEPARATELY. The
# prose checks, because it is somebody else's writing. check-control-bytes,
# because .gitattributes declares `references/** -text` so the corpus is stored
# byte-exact as evidence, and a finding there could only be fixed by editing the
# bytes a citation points at. check-no-secrets, after every hit it produced over
# the corpus was read once and recorded; its own header carries the counts.
# ⚠ A check whose findings cannot be acted on is a check that gets switched off,
# and an exemption taken without reading first is one nobody can defend.

# ⚠ THE ONE FILL-IN FORM IS EXEMPT AND MUST BE. TODO/ENTRY.md is the shape an
# entry is written from, so holding placeholders is its whole job, and a check
# that failed on it would fail on a correct tree. A check that fails on a
# correct tree gets switched off within a week.
# The exemption is by path rather than by content: a file with placeholders
# ANYWHERE ELSE is the defect.
# ⛔ IT NAMES ONE FILE, NOT A DIRECTORY. It used to exempt three whole
# directories inherited from a template repository, two of which have never
# existed here and one of which has been deleted. A directory-shaped exemption
# grants itself to whatever lands there next.
# ⛔ BOTH implementations are exempt, because each one contains the patterns
# it looks for. Exempting only one is how the twins disagree, and it did: the
# sh side scanned the new ps1 twin and reported four categories the ps1 side
# did not.

# 1. A double-brace placeholder.
# ⚠ `${{ }}` is GitHub Actions expression syntax, not a placeholder. A rule that
#    fires on it fires on every correct workflow file, and a rule that fires on
#    correct files gets switched off within a week.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
# The single quotes are deliberate: the literal characters are wanted here, not
# an expansion of them.
# ⚠ `{{.Field}}` is a GO TEMPLATE, not a placeholder. `podman info --format
#    '{{.Host.Arch}}'` and every `docker inspect --format` string has that
#    shape, and this rule fired on one the day a script using it arrived.
#    ⭐ Narrowed rather than switched off, and narrowed on a shape that cannot
#    collide: every placeholder this template ships is a word or a sentence,
#    and every one of them begins with an UPPERCASE letter.
# ⚠ EXCLUDING ONLY `{{.` WAS TOO NARROW, and the gap is not hypothetical: it
#    fired on `podman image inspect --format '{{json .Config.Env}}'` in this
#    repository's own documentation. A Go template calls functions as well as
#    reading fields, so `{{json .X}}`, `{{range .X}}`, `{{printf ...}}`,
#    `{{if .X}}` and `{{end}}` all begin with a lowercase letter instead. The
#    exclusion is therefore "a dot or a lowercase letter", which still cannot
#    collide with a placeholder, and it covers every docker, podman, helm and
#    kubectl format string rather than only field access.
# ⚠ The cost of the wider rule: a placeholder written in lowercase would be
#    missed. None is, the convention is uppercase, and the ⭐ marker rule in
#    docs/conventions/prose.md is the same kind of explicit-list trade.
